# welcome to my repository I am hamza nawabi and in this repo you can find the .htaccess file

### this file is for removing extention from you file when you host your php files and you click the links it comes index.php 

### you can change it to only (index) not need to write index.php 

# STEPS:
### first go to your cpanel 
### login to cpanel 
### go to file manager
### find public_html 
### when you find public html you need to create a file by the name of .htaccess  (remember your show hiden file should be ticked in cpanel)
### then open .htaccess then copy code from my repo and past there and then you can save the file
### then you can access you pages without .php extention be careful to change your links in navbar 
### you need to change you navbar page link EX: "./about.php" convert to "./about"
